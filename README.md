# KLSLPP_tech_BUILDERS_7
Welcome to the Tech_BUILDERS Hackathon Team, where innovation meets expertise!  In the battle against financial fraud, every line of code matters. Our hackathon is laser-focused on addressing the latest challenges in the financial sector, from identity theft to transactional fraud.  
Suppose it is Christmas time and you are throwing a party at your house. You have called all your friends and family. So you go to the supermarket to do some shopping. Standing at the cash counter with a long line behind you the cashier tells you that your card has been declined. With bags full of gifts, wines and cakes you try one more time. But, still the cashier announces that your card has been declined and after sometimes you receive a message ‘Press 1 if you just tried to do transaction of 15000 at Chris supermarket. So, what’s just happened with you is the companies fraud detection system of the card you are using finding some unusual patterns in your transaction. Card fraud is a term used for theft and fraud committed using a payment card, such as debit or credit card as a fraudulent source of funds in the transaction. It can be done either by theft of actual card or by illegally obtaining the cardholder’s account and personal information. Technologies have existed since the early 1990s to detect potential fraud. With the help of machine learning we can find the pattern of usual and unusual behavior of client’s transaction in order to block likely frauds.
